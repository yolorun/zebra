The model has been successfully updated to use individual LSTMs for each neuron:

1. **Dataset Changes** (AllNeuronsDataset):
   - Now returns neuron_idx along with the data
   - This allows routing each sample to the correct LSTM
   
2. **Model Architecture** (LSTMForecaster):
   - Instead of one shared LSTM: nn.ModuleList with one LSTM per neuron
   - Instead of one shared linear layer: nn.ModuleList with one linear layer per neuron
   - Each neuron has its own set of learnable parameters
   
3. **Forward Pass**:
   - Groups samples by neuron for efficient processing
   - Routes each group through its corresponding LSTM
   - Aggregates predictions back into the original batch order
   
4. **Training Process**:
   - The loss is computed across all neurons in each batch
   - Each LSTM only sees data from its assigned neuron
   - Gradients are computed and weights updated per-neuron
   
5. **Key Benefits**:
   - Each neuron can learn its own temporal dynamics
   - No interference between different neurons' patterns
   - More parameters but more specialized models
   
6. **Configuration**:
   - Added 'max_neurons' option to limit neurons for testing
   - The number of neurons is determined from the data
   - Model initialization happens after data setup
